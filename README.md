# RPSGAME

This is a simple CLI game. 

To play, make sure to fork and clone this repo to your terminal. 
Next, make sure you have the latest version of python installed on your computer.

Once you have forked and cloned this repo to your terminal, to start the game, type "python3 run.py" in your terminal. This will start the game.

When you start the game, you will be prompted to enter your name.
The game will display the menu along with graphics of your option and the rules.
You can choose your options and then the computer will select the move.
You will get an update of the score every round with the scoreboard.
You can choose to keep playing or end it whenever you like.

I personally would like to add a timer, audio, and difficulty levels to enhance the game.
If you have any suggestions to improve the game, please feel free to contact me at
